Perspective API is the product of a collaborative research effort by Jigsaw and Google’s Counter Abuse
Technology team exploring machine learning as a tool for better discussions online. The team routinely
publishes datasets, academic research, and open source code as part of their commitment to transparency
and innovation in natural language processing and machine learning. The API provides several pretrained models to compute several scores between 0 and 1 for different categories as follows:

Toxicity is a “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a
discussion.

Severe toxicity is a “very hateful, aggressive, disrespectful comment or otherwise very likely to
make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective.

Identity attack are “negative or hateful comments targeting someone because of their identity.

Insult is an “insulting, inflammatory, or negative comment towards a person or a group of
people.

Profanity are “swear words, curse words, or other obscene or profane language

Threat “describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence against an individual or group.”
